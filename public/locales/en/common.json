	"Question Answer2": "<p>In 2015, US federal agencies provided only about 44% of the total amount spent on basic research in the country. The remaining 56% needs to come from private parties and higher education institutions. While some private companies may be investing in specific applications within neuroscience, it is support for fundamental brain research that is most important because it can lead to huge breakthroughs and quantum steps forward. It was fundamental research, for example, that lead to breakthroughs in DNA, vaccines, solar power and MRIs to name just a few. Support from one company, philanthropist or government agency isn’t enough. We must work together to realize the unparalleled opportunity currently surrounding us.</p>",
	"Question Answer3": "<p>Many major breakthroughs in modern times were made by people under the age of 40 (e.g., Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Marie Curie, Thomas Edison, Stephen Hawking, etc.). We need to ensure there is a constant stream of fresh thinking and support for young scientists in the field so they can explore and advance their research.</p>",
	"Question Answer4": "<p>When Tianqiao and Chrissy first announced that they were focusing their philanthropic efforts on brain science, they were flooded with questions about their choice. They decided to create a short video to address these questions and quickly realized that they had enough exciting content for at least one documentary. They decided to create something that would excite the public about recent advances and show just how close we are to a number of significant breakthroughs. They also wanted to create something could be used by scientists and researcher to make the case that more support is needed from government, philanthropists, businesses and the public if we are to unlock the secrets of the human brain.</p>",
