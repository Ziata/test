We have three core areas of interest.": "我们致力于汇聚大脑研究各个相关领域的杰出人才，包括生物学、化学、工程学、数学、物理学，以及人类和社会科学等领域。共同探索研究人类大脑这个极端精密、复杂的交互系统，揭开感觉、感知和认知形成的秘密。",
	"Brain discovery": "大脑探知",
	"Our primary focus is interdisciplinary research in basic sciences to understand the brain at the level of the individual neuron and synapse. We support research that will deepen understanding of how the brain gathers, organizes and retains information, and translates perceptions into thoughts, emotions, decisions, actions and memories. Currently, a limited understanding of these processes is a bottleneck for new discoveries in both brain treatment and development.": "我们首要关注对人类大脑关键功能的跨学科基础科学研究。这些基础研究涉及最底层的单个神经元和突触的层面。我们资助科学家们深入了解大脑如何对信息加以收集、整理和保存，形成感知，进而如何将感知转化为思想、情绪、决定、行动和记忆。目前，人类对这些过程的了解非常有限，这也成为制约大脑相关疾病治疗和大脑功能开发中取得新发现的最大瓶颈。",
	"Brain treatment": "大脑相关疾病治疗",
	"We seek to translate improved understanding of brain mechanisms and processes into breakthroughs in the treatment of physical and psychological suffering. In particular, we will focus on two severe areas:": "我们寻求通过深入了解大脑相关机制和作用过程，并将此发现转换成治疗人类生理和心理病痛手段上的突破。我们特别关注以下两个方面：",

	"Question Answer1": "<div><ul><li>根据神经科学学会研究，神经系统疾病占据了世界疾病的11％，还不包括了精神健康和成瘾疾病。</li><li>抑郁症影响全球约1.21亿人[1]。</li><li>在美国，有超过1000种神经和神经退行性疾病，影响了接近1亿个美国人的健康[2]。</li></ul><p>这些疾病和紊乱对这些病人产生直接和明显的影响，而他们也会因缺席工作或降低生产力而对我们的经济产生巨大影响<br>[1] European Brain Council<br>[2] The New York Academy of Sciences Magazine</p></div>",
	"Question Answer2": "<p>2015年，美国联邦政府机构仅提供了该国基础脑科学研究总支出的44％，其余的56％来自私人团体和高等教育机构。一些私人公司可能会投资神经科学里的一些特定应用，但最重要的是支持基础大脑研究，因为它可以带来巨大的突破和前进，例如引导DNA、疫苗、太阳能和核磁共振成像等方面的突破。只有一家公司、慈善机构或政府机构的支持是远远不够的。我们必须共同努力，抓住我们目前的巨大机遇，实现历史性的突破。</p>",
	"Question Answer3": "<p>当今时代的许多重大突破都是由40岁以下的人研究发展的（例如爱因斯坦、亚历山大.格雷厄姆贝尔、居里夫人、托马斯.爱迪生、斯蒂芬.霍金等）。我们需要为该领域的年轻科学家提供源源不断的创新思维和支持，以便他们能够探索和推进他们的研究。</p>",
	"Question Answer4": "<p>当陈天桥和雒芊芊首次宣布将他们的慈善事业集中在脑科学上时，他们对自己的选择充满了疑问。他们起初想制作一个简短的视频来回答这些问题，但是他们很快意识到有足够令人兴奋的内容来制作至少一部纪录片。他们希望展示能让大众感到期待的最新技术，让大家了解我们处于面临重大突破的关键时期阶段。他们还希望呼吁如果我们想要揭开人类大脑的秘密，需要政府、慈善家、企业和公众提供更多的支持。</p>",
